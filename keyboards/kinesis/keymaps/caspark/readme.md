# Caspar's keymap

Inspired by https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2016/10/15/multi-purpose-keys/
and by http://www.pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard/arensito_devel/
and https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/kinesis/keymaps/tuesdayjohn

TODO:

* alt tab key?
* tap dance for colon?
* layer for navigation
* layer for mouse keys?
